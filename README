reflow - a terminal text reflower
=================================

Reflow is a command line utility that runs a sub-process
as transparently as possible.  When the controlling terminal
is resized, reflow will wrap any visible text.

Status
------

Reflow is currently in alpha.

Requirements
------------

Reflow is programmed in OCaml with some C stubs.  Reflow
uses Ocamlbuild to compile and link the project.

Installation
------------

Simply running:

	make

from the root project directory will build the executable
'reflow.byte' and place it in the _build directory (with a
symlink in the project root).  If you have the native
OCaml compiler installed you can also build a native
executable by running:

	make native
